# PgBouncer User Authentication with SCRAM-SHA-256
# Format: "username" "SCRAM-SHA-256$..."
#
# IMPORTANT: With auth_query enabled, most users authenticate dynamically via pg_shadow.
# Only the following users need entries in this file:
# - pgbouncer_auth (the auth_user that queries pg_shadow)
# - postgres (superuser, for admin access)
# - pgbouncer_admin (admin user, optional)
#
# To add pgbouncer_auth entry:
# 1. Get SCRAM hash from PostgreSQL: SELECT passwd FROM pg_shadow WHERE usename = 'pgbouncer_auth';
# 2. Add entry: "pgbouncer_auth" "SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:..."
#
# Project authenticator users (proj_xxx_authenticator) use auth_query automatically.
# DO NOT commit production passwords to version control!
