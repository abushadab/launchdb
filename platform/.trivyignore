# CVE-2025-64756: glob command injection vulnerability
# Reason: False positive - vulnerability is in npm CLI's bundled glob package
# Context: npm bundles glob@10.3.7-11.0.3 which has CVE in CLI interface (-c flag)
#          npm only uses glob's library interface, not CLI, so not exploitable
# Reference: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/8741
# Resolution: Will be fixed when npm releases version with glob@11.1.0+
# Last checked: 10 Dec 2025
